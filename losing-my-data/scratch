Yeah
I'm
losing
my
edge.

I'm
losing
my
edge.

The
kids
are
coming
up
from
behind.

I'm
losing
my
edge.

I'm
losing
my
edge
to
the
kids
from
France
and
from
London.

But
I
was
there.

I
was
there
in
1968.

I
was
there
at
the
first
Can
show
in
Cologne.

But
I
was
there.

I
was
there.

But
I
was
there.

I
was
there
in
1974
at
the
first
Suicide
practices
in
a
loft
in
New
York
City.

I
was
working
on
the
organ
sounds
with
much
patience.

I
was
the
first
guy
playing
Daft
Punk
to
the
rock
kids.

I
played
it
at
CBGB's.

We
all
know.

But
I'm
losing
my
edge
to
better-looking
people
with
better
ideas
and
more
talent..


...who
are
actually
really
really
nice.

I
heard
you
have
a
compilation
of
every
good
song
ever
done
by
anybody.

Every
great
song
by
the
Beach
Boys.

All
the
underground
hits.

All
the
Modern
Lovers
tracks.

I
hear
you're
buying
a
synthesizer
and
an
arpeggiator
and
are
throwing
your
computer
out
the
window
because
you
want
to
make
something
real.

You
want
to
make
a
Yaz
record.

I
hear
that
you
and
your
band
have
sold
your
guitars
and
bought
turntables.

I
hear
that
you
and
your
band
have
sold
your
turntables
and
bought
guitars.

I
hear
everybody
that
you
know
is
more
relevant
than
everybody
that
I
know.

But
have
you
seen
my
records?
